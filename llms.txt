# logolink

## Overview

> **Note**: The [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) release of
> `logolink` breaks with the recent NetLogo patch updates because the
> [BehaviorSpace XML
> format](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/XML-File-Format)
> changed. The details are in this [GitHub
> issue](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/issues/2560). If your
> experiments fail to run, install the development version of `logolink`
> from GitHub as shown in the Installation section below. An updated
> [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) release will be submitted soon.

`logolink` is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package that simplifies
setting up and running [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/) simulations
directly from R. It provides a modern, intuitive interface that follows
[tidyverse
principles](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html) and
integrates seamlessly with the [tidyverse
ecosystem](https://tidyverse.org/).

The package is designed to work with NetLogo **7.0.1 and above**. We do
not plan to offer support for earlier versions. See NetLogo’s
[Transition Guide](https://docs.netlogo.org/transition.html) to upgrade
your models if needed.

## Another R Package for NetLogo?

While other R packages connect R to NetLogo, `logolink` is currently the
only one that fully supports the latest NetLogo release. It is actively
maintained, follows [tidyverse
conventions](https://design.tidyverse.org/), and is designed to be
simple and straightforward to use.

For context, [`RNetLogo`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RNetLogo)
supports only older versions (up to 6.0.0, released in December 2016)
and has not been updated since June 2017.
[`nlrx`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nlrx) offers a powerful
framework for managing experiments and results, but
[supports](https://docs.ropensci.org/nlrx/reference/supported_netlogo_versions.html)
only up to NetLogo 6.3.0 (released in September 2022), requires
additional system dependencies, uses its own internal conventions that
diverge from NetLogo standards, has a steep learning curve, and has
[many unresolved issues](https://github.com/ropensci/nlrx/issues).

`logolink` **complements** these packages by prioritizing simplicity,
offering finer control over output, ensuring full compatibility with
NetLogo 7, and integrating seamlessly with modern R workflows.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `logolink` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("logolink")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("danielvartan/logolink")
```

## Usage

`logolink` usage is very straightforward. The main functions are:

- [`create_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/create_experiment.html):
  Create NetLogo BehaviorSpace experiment.
- [`run_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/run_experiment.html):
  Run NetLogo BehaviorSpace experiment.

Along with this package, you will also need NetLogo 7.0.1 or higher
installed on your computer. You can download it from the [NetLogo
website](https://www.netlogo.org).

After installing NetLogo and `logolink`, start by loading the package
with:

``` r
library(logolink)
```

### Setting the NetLogo Path

`logolink` will try to find out the path to the NetLogo installation
automatically. This is usually successful, but if it fails, you will
need to set it manually. In that case, see the documentation for the
[`run_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/run_experiment.html)
function for more details.

### Creating an Experiment

To start running your model from R you first need to setup an
experiment. You can do this by setting a
[BehaviorSpace](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html) experiment
with the
[`create_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/create_experiment.html)
function. This function will create a
[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) file that contains all the
information about your experiment, including the parameters to vary, the
metrics to collect, and the number of runs to perform.

Alternatively, you can set up your experiment [directly in
NetLogo](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#how-it-works) and
save it as part of your model. In this case, you can skip the
[`create_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/create_experiment.html)
step and just provide the name of the experiment when running the model
with
[`run_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/run_experiment.html).

Example:

``` r
setup_file <- create_experiment(
  name = "Wolf Sheep Simple Model Analysis",
  repetitions = 10,
  sequential_run_order = TRUE,
  run_metrics_every_step = TRUE,
  setup = "setup",
  go = "go",
  time_limit = 1000,
  metrics = c(
    'count wolves',
    'count sheep'
  ),
  run_metrics_condition = NULL,
  constants = list(
    "number-of-sheep" = 500,
    "number-of-wolves" = list(
      first = 5,
      step = 1,
      last = 15
    ),
    "movement-cost" = 0.5,
    "grass-regrowth-rate" = 0.3,
    "energy-gain-from-grass" = 2,
    "energy-gain-from-sheep" = 5
  )
)
```

If you want to inspect the created experiment file, you can use the
[`inspect_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/inspect_experiment.html)
function:

``` r
setup_file |> inspect_experiment()
#> <experiments>
#>   <experiment name="Wolf Sheep Simple Model Analysis" repetitions="10" sequentialRunOrder="true" runMetricsEveryStep="true" timeLimit="1000">
#>     <setup>setup</setup>
#>     <go>go</go>
#>     <metrics>
#>       <metric>count wolves</metric>
#>       <metric>count sheep</metric>
#>     </metrics>
#>     <constants>
#>       <enumeratedValueSet variable="number-of-sheep">
#>         <value value="500"></value>
#>       </enumeratedValueSet>
#>       <steppedValueSet variable="number-of-wolves" first="5" step="1" last="15"></steppedValueSet>
#>       <enumeratedValueSet variable="movement-cost">
#>         <value value="0.5"></value>
#>       </enumeratedValueSet>
#>       <enumeratedValueSet variable="grass-regrowth-rate">
#>         <value value="0.3"></value>
#>       </enumeratedValueSet>
#>       <enumeratedValueSet variable="energy-gain-from-grass">
#>         <value value="2"></value>
#>       </enumeratedValueSet>
#>       <enumeratedValueSet variable="energy-gain-from-sheep">
#>         <value value="5"></value>
#>       </enumeratedValueSet>
#>     </constants>
#>   </experiment>
#> </experiments>
```

### Running an Experiment

With the experiment file created, you can now run your model using the
[`run_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/run_experiment.html)
function. This function will execute the NetLogo model with the
specified parameters and return the results as [tidy data
frames](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html).

First, you need to specify the path to your NetLogo model. In this
example, we will use the [Wolf Sheep
Simple](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/IABM%20Textbook/chapter%204/Wolf%20Sheep%20Simple%205.nlogox)
model that comes with any NetLogo installation. For that, we can use the
[`find_netlogo_home`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/find_netlogo_home.html)
function to locate the NetLogo installation directory and then build the
path to the model file.

``` r
model_path <-
  find_netlogo_home() |>
  file.path(
    "models",
    "IABM Textbook",
    "chapter 4",
    "Wolf Sheep Simple 5.nlogox"
  )
```

After specifying the model path, you can run the experiment with:

``` r
results <-
  model_path |>
  run_experiment(
    setup_file = setup_file
  )
```

### Checking the Results

`logolink` supports the [four output
formats](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#run-options-formats)
available in
[BehaviorSpace](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html):
[Table](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#table-output),
[Spreadsheet](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#spreadsheet-output),
[Lists](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#lists-output), and
[Statistics](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#statistics-output).
By default, only the
[Table](https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#table-output) format
is returned, along with some metadata about the experiment run.

``` r
library(dplyr)

results |> glimpse()
#> List of 2
#>  $ metadata:List of 6
#>   ..$ timestamp       : POSIXct[1:1], format: "2026-01-08 00:44:15"
#>   ..$ netlogo_version : chr "7.0.3"
#>   ..$ output_version  : chr "2.0"
#>   ..$ model_file      : chr "Wolf Sheep Simple 5.nlogox"

#>   ..$ world_dimensions: Named int [1:4] -17 17 -17 17
#>   .. ..- attr(*, "names")= chr [1:4] "min-pxcor" "max-pxcor" "min-pycor" "max-pycor"
#>  $ table   : tibble [110,110 × 10] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)

#>   ..$ number_of_wolves      : num [1:110110] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...
#>   ..$ movement_cost         : num [1:110110] 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 ...
#>   ..$ grass_regrowth_rate   : num [1:110110] 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 ...
#>   ..$ energy_gain_from_grass: num [1:110110] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
#>   ..$ energy_gain_from_sheep: num [1:110110] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...
#>   ..$ step                  : num [1:110110] 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
#>   ..$ count_wolves          : num [1:110110] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...
#>   ..$ count_sheep           : num [1:110110] 500 499 498 496 495 494 491 489 488 488 ...
```

If you already have an file with experiment results, you can read it
into R using the
[`read_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/read_experiment.html)
function, which will yield the same output structure as
[`run_experiment`](https://danielvartan.github.io/logolink/reference/run_experiment.html).

### Analyzing the Data (Bonus Section)

Below is a simple example of how to visualize the results using
[`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)

data <-
  results |>
  extract2("table") |>
  select(where(is.numeric)) |>
  summarize(
    across(everything(), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)),
    .by = c(step, number_of_wolves)
  ) |>
  arrange(number_of_wolves, step)
```

``` r
library(ggplot2)

data |>
  mutate(number_of_wolves = as.factor(number_of_wolves)) |>
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = step,
      y = count_sheep,
      group = number_of_wolves,
      color = number_of_wolves
    )
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Time Step",
    y = "Average Number of Sheep",
    color = "Wolves"
  )
```
