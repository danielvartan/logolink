\title{Read BehaviorSpace Experiment Output}
\usage{
read_experiment(file, tidy_output = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A \code{\link[base:character]{character}} string specifying the path to
the BehaviorSpace output
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values}{CSV}
file.}

\item{tidy_output}{(optional) A \code{\link[base:logical]{logical}} flag indicating
whether to tidy the output data frames. If \code{TRUE}, output data frames are
arranged according to
\href{https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html}{tidy data principles}.
If \code{FALSE}, only the default transformations from
\code{\link[readr:read_delim]{read_delim()}} and
\code{\link[janitor:clean_names]{clean_names()}} are applied to the output data
(default: \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[base:list]{list}} containing the experiment results. The list
includes the following elements, depending on the output file provided:
\itemize{
\item \code{metadata}: A \code{\link[base:list]{list}} with metadata about the experiment
run (present in all cases).
\item \code{table}: A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}} with the results of the
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#table-output}{\code{table}}
output.
\item \code{spreadsheet}: A \code{\link[base:list]{list}} with the results of the
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#spreadsheet-output}{\code{spreadsheet}}
output containing two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{statistics}: A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}} with data from the
output first section.
\item \code{data}: A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}} with data from the
output second section.
}
\item \code{lists}: A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}} with the results of the
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#lists-output}{\code{lists}}
output.
\item \code{statistics}: A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble}} with the results of the
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#statistics-output}{\code{statistics}}
output.
}
}
\description{
\code{read_experiment()} reads
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html}{BehaviorSpace}
experiment output files generated by NetLogo as
\href{https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html}{tidy data frames}.
It automatically detects the output format (
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#table-output}{Table},
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#spreadsheet-output}{Spreadsheet},
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#lists-output}{Lists}, or
\href{https://docs.netlogo.org/behaviorspace.html#statistics-output}{Stats}
) and parses the data accordingly. The function also extracts metadata from
the file.

Only version 2.0 (NetLogo 6.4 and later) of BehaviorSpace output files is
supported.
