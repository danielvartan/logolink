### Propose an Idea üí°

Have an idea for a new `logolink` feature? Take a look at the [documentation][website] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][issues]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.

### Report a Bug üêõ

Using `logolink` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* The content of `utils::sessionInfo()`.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug (Tip: Use the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package).

### Improve the Documentation üìñ

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!

#### The Website

The [website][website] is generated with [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any HTML: Content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to improve documentation.

#### Function Documentation

Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:

1. Go to the `R` directory in the [code repository][repo].
2. Look for the file with the function.
3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).

### Contribute Code üìù

Care to fix bugs or implement new functionality for `logolink`? Awesome! üëè Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.

## Development Guidelines

We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development. This means all changes should be made in feature branches, submitted as pull requests, and reviewed before merging into the main branch. Please keep your branches focused on a single topic or fix to make reviews easier and the project history clearer. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
2. If you have forked and cloned the project before, and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream main`.
3. Open the project in your [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
4. Make your changes:
    - Write your code.
    - Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).
    - Document your code (see function documentation above).
    - Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors, warnings, and notes.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).

Please ensure your code adheres to the [tidyverse design guide](https://principles.tidyverse.org/) and the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). All contributions should follow these principles and conventions to maintain consistency and readability throughout the project.
